### Book Manuscript in Progress
_Reading Practice: The Pursuit of Natural Knowledge from Manuscript to Print_ (under advanced contract with the University of Chicago Press, now under review)

When you feel sick, you might Google your symptoms. When you need to change a bike tire, maybe you search YouTube for a step-by-step video. A world of medical, scientific, and technical information is now just a few clicks away, and yet, never has a society been less sure how to handle so much knowledge. How do we determine what’s effective, what’s useful, and what’s true? Six hundred years ago, English people seeking medical advice or technical know-how didn’t have Google or YouTube, but they were facing their own information revolution, built on a similarly transformative information technology: the how-to book. Like us, they found themselves with new access to a world of information, and, like us, they wondered how to make sense of it all. _Reading Practice: The Pursuit of Natural Knowledge from Manuscript to Print_, tells the story of how English readers learned to master the information at their fingertips. In two centuries of everyday interactions with ordinary books, the English learned to use their experience to assess the validity and utility of medical and scientific knowledge and to embrace new roles as purveyors of that knowledge in their own right.

### Works in Progress

"Old Books, New Science," an initiative to publish a digital edition of Bodleian MS Ashmole Add. B.246, a fifteenth-century manuscript owned by a sixteenth-century collector, Henry Dyngley, who later authored his own recipe collection. This project seeks to understand the generational transfer of medical and scientific knowledge through the collection, ammendation, and authorship of manuscript recipe books by digitizing the library of one prolific early modern collector. The initiative is funded by the National Science Foundation as part of a grant, “Crafting an Open Source Digital Publication Tool for the History of Science,” submitted by Pamela Smith (Columbia University). The multiple collaborators on this grant will test and implement EditionCrafter, an open source program for creating digital editions in the classroom.
