## Works in Progress
<hr>
#### Peer-reviewed articles
"Of Plants and Providence: _Materia medica_ and Bodily Difference in a Global Resource Landscape," prepared for the special issue, "Resource Landscapes: Ecologies, Labor, and Investment in the Early Modern World" in _Renaissance Quarterly_, co-edited by Renée Raphael and Tina Asmussen (under review)

#### Journal Forum
Co-editor (with Hannah Frydman, University of Washington) of a prospective forum of articles on "Reproductive Rights Beyond Roe" for the journal _Gender & History_ (under review)

#### Digital Editions
[_Old Books, New Science_](https://cu-mkp.github.io/dyngleyfamily-editioncrafter-website/) is an initiative to digitally reconstruct the manuscript library of Henry Dyngley, a sixteenth-century English collector of Middle English medical manuscripts. 
The project seeks to understand why early modern readers collected medieval medical and scientific knowledge in old manuscripts, how generations of readers engaged with these manuscripts over time, and what role these older books played in the development of new epistemologies associated with the scientific revolution.
_Old Books, New Science_ is as one of several trial projects associated with EditionCrafter, a publication tool for digital critical editions under development (2022-2024) by the 
[Making and Knowing Project](https://makingandknowing.org/) (M&K), [Performant Software Solutions](https://www.performantsoftware.com/), 
and a number of case-study collaborators. EditionCrafter is designed to be an open-source, customizable 
publishing tool that will allow users to deploy their own texts, data, and commentary as 
low-maintenance digital critical editions. For more about this work, see the NSF award 
announcement: [Crafting an Open Source Digital Publication Tool for the History of Science](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2218218&HistoricalAwards=false).
