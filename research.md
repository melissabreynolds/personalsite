A lot of my research is published in venues that are difficult to access if you're not an academic
with institutional subscriptions to journals. This can be frustrating given that the questions I seek
to answer about people living 400 to 500 years ago—how did they understand their place in the natural world as
so much was changing following new discoveries? How did they access information about this changing world,
and what did they think of these new ideas when they encountered them?—are questions that resonate
with us today as we navigate an ever-changing information economy and a changing planet. This page
is an attempt to remedy the problem of access. Here you'll find presentations, podcasts, and websites where I describe my research for interested
readers and thinkers outside academia.

## My Book
<hr>
My first book,[_Reading Practice: The Pursuit of Natural Knowledge from Manuscript to Print_](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/R/bo222256991.html) (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2024),
is available in paperback from the University of Chicago Press. Though it is an academic monograph,
the stories it tells of readers and their books more than 500 years ago may appeal to anyone
who has searched Dr. Google to diagnose a rash or watched a YouTube video to learn how to 
mend a shirt or cook a meal. It's also a great read for book nerds!

If you'd like to learn more about the book, you can listen to [this interview](https://newbooksnetwork.com/reading-practice) I did with Sarah
Bramao-Ramos of New Books Network, all about the research, arguments, and ideas that went into __Reading Practice.__

For a bit more detailed (and academic) preview of the book, you could watch [this talk](https://videocast.nih.gov/watch=48702) I gave for
the National Library of Medicine's "History Talks" series in November 2023, with the added bonus that you'll get to see images of a few of the manuscripts I study.

Or, you might listen to
this episode of _Chasing Leviathan_, ["Medicine, Magic, and Literacy in Early Modern England"](https://youtube.com/@chasingleviathan?si=gKkajgW0_k8JXAs3), 
recorded on September 8, 2024, for a general discussion of the book with a non-academic reader. 

Finally, data enthusiasts or 
manuscript nerds may also wish to browse the website I built to house the bibliographical data behind the book: [_A Digital Companion to Reading Practice_](https://readingpractice.github.io).

## A Cool Manuscript in Digital Facsimile
<hr>
[![Secrets of Craft and Nature Image](/images/makingandknowing.jpg){: width="600px" .left-image}](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org) From 2015–2018, I was a member of the translation and transcription team for the _Making and Knowing Projcet_, led by
Professor Pamela Smith of Columbia University. Professor Smith had the brilliant idea to bring together
graduate students in the history of art and history of science to work collaboratively on a critical edition of 
Bibliothèque nationale de France MS Fr. 640, a late sixteenth-century manuscript filled with all variety of
craft recipes. Not only did we transcribe and translate the manuscript from Middle French to English, our team also
used TEI-encoding to mark up the text so that users can quickly search its contents for information on materials and
ingredients used within the recipes, people and places referenced in the manuscript, techniques used, and sensory perceptions
described by the practitioner. Our transcriptions and translations were then referenced by teams of 
graduate students who worked in labs at Columbia University over several semesters to reproduce the recipes
within the manuscript, in the process learning about the relationship between "making and knowing" about nature
in early modern France.

The completed edition, Pamela Smith et al., eds., _Secrets of Craft and Nature in Renaissance France: A Digital Critical Edition and English
Translation of Bibliothèque nationale de France MS Fr. 640_, is freely accessible at [edition640.makingandknowing.org](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org). 
Users of the site will be able to view high-resolution images of the original manuscript alongside our translations 
and transcriptions, but even cooler, they'll be able to watch videos and read essays describing students' attempts to
try their hands at sixteenth-century techniques for metal casting, taxidermy, artistic reproductions, and other very cool craft
techniques captured in BnF MS fr.640.


## A Manuscript Edition in Progress
<hr>
Inspired by the success of _Secrets of Craft and Nature_, Professor Smith received a National Science Foundation Grant (#2218218) to
create a publication tool for digital critical editions. This tool, the software EditionCrafter, is currently under development (2022-2024) by the 
[Making and Knowing Project](https://makingandknowing.org/) (M&K), [Performant Software Solutions](https://www.performantsoftware.com/), 
and a number of case-study collaborators. EditionCrafter is designed to be an open-source, customizable 
publishing tool that will allow users to deploy their own texts, data, and commentary as 
low-maintenance digital critical editions. For more about this work, see the NSF award 
announcement: [Crafting an Open Source Digital Publication Tool for the History of Science](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2218218&HistoricalAwards=false). 

As one of the collaborators on this project, I have begun work on [_Old Books, New Science_](https://cu-mkp.github.io/dyngleyfamily-editioncrafter-website/),
an initiative to digitally reconstruct the manuscript library of Henry Dyngley, a sixteenth-century English collector of Middle English medical manuscripts. 
The project seeks to understand why early modern readers collected medieval medical and scientific knowledge in old manuscripts, how generations of readers 
engaged with these manuscripts over time, and what role these older books played in the development of new epistemologies associated with the scientific revolution.
_Old Books, New Science_ is very much  work-in-progress, though interested readers will be able to see transcriptions of the first
few pages of one of Dyngley's manuscripts, Trinity College Cambridge MS O.8.35, at the project site.

## Op-Eds, Blog Posts, and Podcast Interviews
<hr>
As an educator and a historian, I'm always looking for outlets that will allow me to share 
my research about the past and connect that research to contemporary questions or problems. Below, you'll find 
links to op-eds, blog posts, and podcasts all about my research, and sometimes about the relationship between premodern history and contemporary politics.
