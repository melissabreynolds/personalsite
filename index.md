I am a cultural historian of medieval and early modern Europe with broad research interests in the history of medicine and science, the history of gender and the body, and the history of material texts. I am Assistant Professor of Early Modern European History at TCU, where I teach survey courses on the history of early modern Europe from the Black Death to the French Revolution, and upper level seminars on the history of science and communications technologies in history. You can view syllabi and learn more about these courses [here](/syllabi.md). [Headshot](/images/headshot.jpg){: width="200px" .right-image}

My first book, [_Reading Practice: The Pursuit of Natural Knowledge from Manuscript to Print_](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/R/bo222256991.html) was published by the University of Chicago Press in 2024 and was recently awarded the [John Ben Snow Prize](https://www.nacbs.org/prize-database/john-ben-snow-prize) from the North American Council on British Studies, for best book in any field of British Studies, pre-1800. Read more about the book (or listen to podcast interviews) [here](/research.md).

In addition to writing academic books and article, I also co-edit [_The Recipes Project_](https://recipes.hypotheses.org), a quarterly online publication devoted to recipe studies of all kinds.
