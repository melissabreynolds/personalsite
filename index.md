Dr. Melissa Reynolds is a cultural historian of medieval and early modern Europe with broad research interests in the
history of medicine and science, the history of gender and the body, and the history of
material texts. In her research and teaching, she is particularly interested in
tracing how elite or learned cultures of medical and scientific knowledge are conveyed
to ‘ordinary’ people through non-elite media, and in turn, how access to this knowledge
brought about cultural change. She is an assistant professor of early modern European history
at Texas Christian University. Previously, she was a Mellon postdoctoral fellow in the Wolf Humanities
Center and a Lecturer in History and Sociology of Science at the University of Pennsylvania, 
and the Perkins-Cotsen Postdoctoral Fellow in the Society of Fellows in
the Liberal Arts and a Lecturer in History at Princeton University. She received her Ph.D.
in History from Rutgers University, and a BA and MA from the University of Alabama. ![Headshot](/images/headshot.jpg){: width="200px" .right-image}

Reynolds's first book, [_Reading Practice: The Pursuit of Natural Knowledge from Manuscript to Print_](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/R/bo222256991.html) (Chicago, 2024) tells the story of how ordinary English people grew comfortable learning from 
commonplace manuscripts and printed books, such as almanacs, medical recipe collections, 
and herbals. From the turn of the fifteenth century to the close of the sixteenth century, 
these were the books English people read when they wanted to attend to their health or 
understand their place in the universe. Before then, these works had largely been the 
purview of those who could read Latin. Around 1400, however, medical and scientific texts 
became available in Middle English while manuscripts became less expensive. These vernacular 
manuscripts invited their readers into a very old and learned conversation: Hippocrates 
and Galen weren’t distant authorities whose word was law, they were trusted guides, whose 
advice could be excerpted, rearranged, recombined, and even altered to suit a manuscript 
compiler’s needs. This conversation continued even after the printing press arrived in 
England in 1476. Printers mined manuscripts for medical and scientific texts that they 
would publish throughout the sixteenth century, though the pressures of a commercial 
printing market encouraged printers to package these old texts in new ways. Without the 
weight of authority conditioning their reactions and responses to very old knowledge, and 
with so many editions of practical books to choose from, English readers grew into 
confident critics and purveyors of natural knowledge in their own right. To learn
more about the book's argument, and to see some of the manuscript and printed sources that play a role in its
narrative, watch [this talk](https://videocast.nih.gov/watch=48702), part of the National 
Library of Medicine's History Talks series, or browse the bibliographical data behind the book

She has also written
about a little known [early modern epidemic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/03/18/communication-failures-pandemic-can-be-catastrophic/)
and about lessons to be learned from [pre-modern reproductive medicine](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/05/09/key-lowering-americas-high-rates-maternal-mortality/) in the _Washington Post_. 
She is a longtime contributor and editorial team member for the scholarly blog, The Recipes Project,
where she has written on [perpetual prognostications,](https://recipes.hypotheses.org/17522)
