I am the Perkins-Cotsen Postdoctoral Fellow in the Society of Fellows in
the Liberal Arts and a Lecturer in History at Princeton University. I received my Ph.D.
in History from Rutgers University, and a BA and MA from the University of Alabama. ![Headshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/headshot.jpg){: width="200px" .right-image} I am
a cultural historian of medieval and early modern Europe with broad research interests in the
history of medicine and science, the history of gender and the body, and the history of
material texts. In my research and teaching, I am particularly interested in
tracing how elite or learned cultures of medical and scientific knowledge are conveyed
to ‘ordinary’ people through non-elite media, and in turn, how access to this knowledge
brought about cultural change.

I am currently at work on my first book, _How To Read Like an Experimenter: Medicine, Science, and Practical Books in England, 1400–1600_, which tells the story of how ordinary English readers embraced new roles as consumers, purveyors, and adjudicators of medical and scientific knowledge in everyday encounters with ordinary how-to books. From an earlier medieval culture that kept most medicine and science confined to monastic libraries or university lecture halls, how-to books emerged around the turn of the fifteenth century as the means by which artisans, merchants, landed farmers, or village priests were able to collect information useful to their daily lives. The treatises, recipes, and instructions that fill hundreds of these fifteenth-century manuscripts eventually served as models for printed how-to books, marketed to new generations of readers as novel and original when, in reality, they were anything but. Over two centuries of extraordinary growth in the circulation of medical and scientific knowledge, the English learned to be discerning readers, parsing new information and making value judgements about competing knowledge claims. Through analysis of nearly 200 fifteenth-century manuscripts and over 500 editions of printed how-to books, I show that it was these ordinary readers, just as much as famous experimenters and natural philosophers, who shaped a culture of intellectual exchange and inquiry befitting a scientific revolution.


I've published or have scholarly articles forthcoming in the [_Journal of British Studies_](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-british-studies/article/here-is-a-good-boke-to-lerne-practical-books-the-coming-of-the-press-and-the-search-for-knowledge-ca-14001560/8217EBC4F6CE53F1084709587B7C2E12/share/a024150fe1501e59df5b45628147fdd3df550196) and in _Social History of Medicine_. I've also written
about a little known [early modern epidemic](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/03/18/communication-failures-pandemic-can-be-catastrophic/)
and about lessons to be learned from [pre-modern reproductive medicine](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/05/09/key-lowering-americas-high-rates-maternal-mortality/) in the _Washington Post_.
I am a longtime contributor and editorial team member for the scholarly blog, The Recipes Project,
where I've written on [perpetual prognostications,](https://recipes.hypotheses.org/17522)
[reproductive medical recipes,](https://recipes.hypotheses.org/15134) and [playful magic](https://recipes.hypotheses.org/14220) in medieval recipe books.
My research has been supported by Princeton's University Committee on Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences, the American Council of Learned Societies, the Richard III Society and the Medieval
Academy of America, the Folger Shakespeare Library, and the Rare Books School at the
University of Virginia.
