Dr. Melissa Reynolds is a cultural historian of medieval and early modern Europe with broad research interests in the
history of medicine and science, the history of gender and the body, and the history of
material texts. In her research and teaching, she is particularly interested in
tracing how elite or learned cultures of medical and scientific knowledge are conveyed
to ‘ordinary’ people through non-elite media, and in turn, how access to this knowledge
brought about cultural change.  

Reynolds is Assistant Professor of early modern European history
at Texas Christian University. Previously, she was a Mellon postdoctoral fellow in the Wolf Humanities Center and a Lecturer in History and Sociology of Science at the University of Pennsylvania, 
and the Perkins-Cotsen Postdoctoral Fellow in the Society of Fellows in
the Liberal Arts and a Lecturer in History at Princeton University. She received her Ph.D.
in History from Rutgers University, and a BA and MA from the University of Alabama. ![Headshot](/images/headshot.jpg){: width="200px" .right-image}

Reynolds's first book, [_Reading Practice: The Pursuit of Natural Knowledge from Manuscript to Print_](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/R/bo222256991.html) (Chicago, 2024), 
shows how ordinary English readers grew to be selective
and discerning consumers of knowledge in everyday interactions with inexpensive, utilitarian books like
medical recipe collections, almanacs, and agricultural manuals. Though these books rarely contained
revolutionary scientific or medical knowledge, their increasing availability and importance within
English lives had revolutionary consequences. By tracing the proliferation of these "practical books"—first, in manuscript, and later, in print—
Reynolds reconstructs shifting attitudes toward medicine and science over two centuries of seismic change 
within English culture, attending especially to the effects of the printing press and the Reformation on attitudes 
toward nature and the human body. 


Reynolds has published articles and essays in the [_Journal of British Studies_](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-british-studies/article/here-is-a-good-boke-to-lerne-practical-books-the-coming-of-the-press-and-the-search-for-knowledge-ca-14001560/8217EBC4F6CE53F1084709587B7C2E12/share/a024150fe1501e59df5b45628147fdd3df550196),
